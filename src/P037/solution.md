# Truncatable primes
Any number that ends in 0, 4, 6 or 8 is divisible by 2, and therefore not prime. Since the number is being truncated from right to left, every digit will end up being the last digit. So, it follows that the number cannot contain the digits 0, 4, 6 or 8.

Following the same logic, digits 2 and 5 can be present only as the most significant digits.

Since the number is also being truncated from left to right, the least significant digit must also be prime, so it can only be 3 or 7.

The middle digits can be 1, 3, 7 or 9.

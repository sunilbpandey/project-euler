# Number letter counts
There is no clever math involved here, just a simple set of rules:

- All numbers below 20 have unique names - "one", "two", ... "nineteen"
- For numbers above 19 and below 100, extract the decade, which has a unique name, then use the above rule to name the remainder - e.g. "twenty one", "fifty six" etc.
- For numbers above 99, extract the century, then use the above rules to name the remainder - e.g. "two hundred and thirty nine" etc.

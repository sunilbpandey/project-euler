# Digit fifth powers
The important point here is to figure out the upper bound.

The largest possible sum of fifth powers of digits for a 7-digit number is $7 * 9^5 = 413343$. Since this number has only 6 digits, we can see that no number of 7 of more digits can be written as the sum of fifth power of its digits.

Further, observe that in a sum, the order of numbers doesn't matter. Since the sum of fourth powers of 1, 3, 4 and 6 contains the same digits - 1, 3, 4 and 6, we know that we can construct a four-digit number using those digits such that it is equal to the sum of fourth powers of its digits.

This reduces the problem to finding sets of up to 6 digits, such that the sum of fifth powers of those digits contains the same digits.

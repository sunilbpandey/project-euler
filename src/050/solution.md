# Consecutive prime sum
This problem can be solved using a simple brute force approach. First, generate a list of prime numbers until their sum exceeds one million. Now, starting with the first prime number, generate sums of consecutive prime numbers and test if the sum is a prime number, until we find the one with maximum number of terms.

# Even Fibonacci numbers

While this problem is easy enough to solve by simply walking the sequence until we see a term exceeding four million, we can make small optimizations.

The sequence starts with `a = 1` and `b = 2`, with subsequent terms generated by adding the previous two terms. Since the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd, and the sum of two odd numbers is even, this means that both the third and fourth terms will be odd, and the fifth will be even.

In fact, after the first two terms, the sequence will continue in this manner:

```
odd, odd, even, odd, odd even, ...
```

Further, if we instead start the sequence with `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the entire sequence follows that pattern, without affecting the final sum of even-valued terms:

```
odd, odd, even, odd, odd even, ...
```

This means there is no need to check whether a term is even, simply add every third term.

To generate the terms, observe that if the first two terms are `a` and `b`, the next three terms will be:

```
(a + b), (a + 2b), (2a + 3b)
```

So add `(a + b)` to the sum and set `a` and `b` to `(a + 2b)` and `(2a + 3b)`, respectively.

# Roman Numerals

This problem can be easily solved by converting the given numbers to decimal and then back to Roman numerals, and comparing the number of letters.

But since all the given numbers are valid and don't contain more than four consecutive identical numerals, we can also solve this with simple string substitution, without having to do any conversion at all.

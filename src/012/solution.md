# Highly divisible triangular number

Consider a number $n$ written in terms of its prime factors:

$$
n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \dots
$$

Every divisor of $n$ must include zero or more of one or more of these prime numbers. So the total number of divisors of $n$ can be calculated as:

$$
d = (a_1 + 1) (a_2 + 1) \dots
$$

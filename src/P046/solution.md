# Goldbach's other conjecture
No complex algorithms needed for this one, simply test every odd number greater than 9 until we find the correct one.

For efficiency, we can assume that there is a solution below one million, and pre-compute all primes below 1000. But the same algorithm will work without this assumption too.

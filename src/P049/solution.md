# Prime permutations
There are at least a couple of ways of solving this.

One approach is to go through all 4-digit prime numbers one by one, generate all possible permutations of its digits, filter out prime numbers from those permutations and see if they form an arithmetic sequence.

Another approach is to go through all 4-digit prime numbers, group them by their digits, then analyze each group to find three numbers which form an arithmetic sequence.

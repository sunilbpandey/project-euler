# Sum square difference

Since the problem is limited to only first 100 natural numbers, a brute force solution is fast enough. But the two sums can be computed more directly.

Sum of first $n$ natural numbers is given by this formula:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^nk = \frac{1}{2}n\left(n + 1\right)
$$

Sum of squares of first $n$ natural numbers is given by this formula:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^nk^2 = \frac{1}{6}n\left(n + 1\right)\left(2n + 1\right)
$$
